Hamzah has 3 forms: أ - ؤ - ئ. Long vowels are   ا ,   و , and  ي and they are use for elongation. Short vowels are 3 : fathha, kasrah, dummah. Short Vowels are  بَ    بِ    بُ . Long Vowels بَا     بِى     بُو .  Sakoon(o)  is not a vowel sign. In the word  بُو there is no vowel sign on و so there is sakoon and ب  has dammah. "

Arabic has no word corresponding to the English word IS  , i.e. Arabic has no copula. There is no word in Arabic corresponding to A in English as in THIS IS A BOOK. The n-sound at the end of the Arabic noun (kitabu-n, baitu-n, masjidu-n) is the Arabic indefinite article corresponding to the English A/AN. This n-sound is called tanwin. e.g. This is a house. هَذَا بَيْتٌ. The particle placed at the beginning of a statement turns it into a question, e.g. This is a house. هَذَا بَيْتٌ   Is this a house?    أَ هَذَا بَيْتٌ "
